		<h3>Csikszentmihalyi, "Why We Need Things"</h3>

			<p>Csikszentmihalyi offers up a western capitalist view of objects and their position in society. He suggests objects serve three purposes: to demonstrate power, to situate their owners in time and to represent relationships through tangible things. While it is clear Csikszentmihalyi is a talented psychologist, the text itself offers answers to those of us in the west, albeit in a way that suggests only binary genders and reinforces stereotypes. For instance, while he constantly uses the word "most" and even seems surprised that "gender stereotypes still flourish" (26). I question his methodology of his study. I also realize this was written in a time before intersectionality became important, but he constantly reinforces a gender binary that can't be conducive to conversation. I wonder if Csikszentmihalyi would rewrite this today what would come of the work - the more I am told what I should be the less I want to be it, or have some sort of guilt towards liking what I ought to like.<br><br>

			However, I do agree with his constant link to objects and relationships: I see it everywhere especially in myself, keeping cards and notes that are of no longer use but mean a lot to me since they came from loved ones. The idea of also physically carrying a representation of a person with you is comforting -- when I see an object that someone has given me my thoughts will always go to them. This makes me think of the knitting community and their "sweater curse" -- where a knitter will break up with their significant other before they can finish knitting them a sweater. We can see here that knitting, a practice that is slow and laborious when done by hand, is a demonstration of love and commitment directly embedded in an object.

		<h3>HOW TO GET WHAT YOU WANT</h3>

			<p><a href="http://www.kobakant.at/DIY/?p=3649">WEAVING CONDUCTIVE FABRIC</a> -- there is something very beautiful about woven fabrics. They are one of the oldest kind of fabric and have unique properties, such as a lack of stretch as well as a grid like layout instead of a continuous interlinked string. The idea of combining radically new technologies with one of the most ancient forms of craft is a beautiful juxtaposition. By embedding the technology in the fabric it can be used as a decorative piece, not only as a structural aid. As well, it can either show off or hide the technology: transforming the fabric into either something it is or something it is not. Weaving is personally my favourite kind of textile craft. </p>
			<p><a href="http://www.kobakant.at/DIY/?p=4718">CARD WEAVING WORKSHOP</a> -- this workshop combines the first ever application of a computer, the weaving loom, together with the traditional elements of non permanent objects. The idea of weaving with simple cardboard and no need for a giant loom is amazing, you can make intricate patters as seen in weaving conductive fabric, but on a smaller and more portable scale.</p>

				CONDUCTIVE PLASTIC -- Alan Heeger and his team won the 2000 Nobel Prize for figuring out a way to make plastic conductive. This juxtaposition of a material that is known to be entirely unconductive - even used to protect wires from each other and the earth, being used in a way that we previously thought impossible. This idea of working with a product that has been used for decades in one way and finally using it in its opposite application is exciting.

				<br><br>

				BIODEGRADABLE PLASTIC -- In the same vein, biodegradable plastic performs a task that the usual plastic material can take thousands of years to do - it degrades well and quickly. Plantic Technologies designed this material with a cornstarch base that can be used in many applications.

				<br><br>

				COMBINE -- It would then be a great idea to combine both ideas into one super plastic - that is both biodegradable and conductive, which could be used in electronics in a more ecologically concious way.
