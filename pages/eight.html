<b>How</b> some indigenous names remained and persisted had two possibilities. Some families were able to retain their old nomenclature because, before the decree was imposed, these families had been registered in the town census as pacified, baptized and had paid their taxes.<br><br>

The other possibility was that the old surnames were not changed because their names were already registered in the government books or municipalities for some misdemeanors (prison cells). The most likely explanation was that others fled to the hills.<br><br>

<b>What if the Catalogo never happened?</b> We would have had a most interesting study of names indeed, a rich tapestry of an ancient, patriotic, indigenous and very non-Hispanic onomastic history.<br><br>

In order to find out what our pre-Hispanic names were before Claveria’s Catalogue of Surnames went into effect, I had to dig deep into our legends and myths.1 There I discovered a very interesting naming truth. Some of our forebears were named after their grandfathers!<br><br>

Let me start with the letters of the alphabet and just allow me to identify five indigenous surnames. Our readers may be familiar with some of them.
